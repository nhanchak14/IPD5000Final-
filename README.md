# IPD5000Final-
This is for our IPD 5000 Final project (Nick, Yue, Carmen). Our project is to create an alarm clock car. IT responds to your pre-set alarm time, and at this time, prompts the motors of the wheels to start moving, and plays a sound through a built-in speaker using a music maker MP3 shield. 
This project uses the AdaFruit_VS1053 Library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_VS1053_Library) for the music maker shield
This project uses the RTClib library (https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib) for the RTC module that codes for the set alarm time
This was also used for help (https://forum.arduino.cc/t/how-to-use-rtc-for-correcting-stepper-motor-rpm/1206257)
Max, the TAs, other friends, as well as ChatGPT were used to help detect errors in the code and help us fix them.
