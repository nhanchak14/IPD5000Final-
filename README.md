# IPD5000Final-
This is for our IPD 5000 Final project (Nick, Yue, Carmen). Our project is to create an alarm clock car. It responds to your pre-set alarm time, and at this time, prompts the motors of the wheels to start moving, and plays a sound through a built-in speaker using a music maker MP3 shield. 
This project uses the AdaFruit_VS1053 Library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_VS1053_Library) for the music maker shield
This project uses the RTClib library (https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib) for the RTC module that codes for the set alarm time
This was also used for help (https://forum.arduino.cc/t/how-to-use-rtc-for-correcting-stepper-motor-rpm/1206257)
We used the wheel base from the Detkin lab and used other sensors/materials from the Detkin lab as well as the IPD studio.
Max, the TAs, other friends, as well as ChatGPT were used to help generate and refine our code and debug for errors.
