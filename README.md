# IPD5000Final-
Description: This is for our IPD 5000 Final project (Nick, Yue, Carmen). Our project is to create an alarm clock car. It responds to your pre-set alarm time, and at this time, prompts the motors of the wheels to start moving, and plays a sound through a built-in speaker using a music maker MP3 shield. 
This project uses the AdaFruit_VS1053 Library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_VS1053_Library) for the music maker shield.
This project uses the RTClib library (https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib) for the RTC module that codes for the set alarm time.
This project also uses  SD/wire libraries (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries) for SD card access.
This was also used for help and reference (https://forum.arduino.cc/t/how-to-use-rtc-for-correcting-stepper-motor-rpm/1206257)
We used the wheel base from the Detkin lab and borrowed code for basic motor controls (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1npt_h8X4EoTk62ZUFpgeEifBo6xL_BA8).
Max, the TAs, other friends, as well as AI were used to help generate and refine our code and debug for errors.
Future considerations: Adding multiple motion/ultrasonic sensors to detect position and movement to ensure better automated movement troughout the room. Pairing the alarm set in the device with a phone alarm to integrate these functions together would also make the process much easier.
